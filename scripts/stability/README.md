# Nightly storage stability

`.github/workflows/nightly_stability.yml` runs daily at 01:30 Asia/Shanghai and
supports manual dispatch on a selected branch. The workflow starts running on a
schedule after it is merged into the default branch. A supplied `seed` reproduces
process-test ordering and power-loss cut selection; `cuts` defaults to eight per
workload. Neither FTS failures nor infrastructure failures are skipped or marked
as expected failures.

## Jobs

| Job | Scope |
| --- | --- |
| Build | Release binaries, Linux preload library, and harness unit tests |
| Recovery | Three shuffled rounds of all CMake-registered crash recovery suites |
| Disk full | Blocks and inodes exhausted separately during insert, flush, and optimize, with plain and FTS schemas |
| I/O errors | One-shot/persistent EIO at initial calls, after partial writes, and at manifest writes; optimize also targets forward/vector/FTS files |
| Power loss | Block-write recording for each operation/schema, then replay of eight sampled prefixes including both operation-boundary marks |

A failing case is recorded in JUnit; other cases continue, and the runner returns
a nonzero status.
An operation that unexpectedly succeeds after an injected fault also fails its
case. The audit log must prove the fault actually reached the database's file
operations; filling the disk or merely loading the injector is not sufficient.

## Runner requirements

The default is `ubuntu-24.04`. Storage jobs require an unprivileged test user with
passwordless sudo, loop devices, ext4 mounting, and sufficient local disk space.
Power-loss recording additionally requires the `dm_log_writes` kernel module and
device-mapper access. If the hosted image does not provide these, preflight fails
explicitly. Select a compatible Ubuntu 24.04 x86-64 runner through the repository
variable `STABILITY_RUNNER`, containing a JSON string or label array, for example:

```json
["self-hosted", "Linux", "X64", "storage"]
```

Only newly allocated loop devices and uniquely named mapper targets are used.
Each case has a 128 MiB test filesystem; recording also uses a 256 MiB log image.
The database worker is never run as root. Successful images are removed; failed
images remain in uploaded artifacts. Cancellation attempts cleanup via SIGTERM;
a forcibly killed runner must be recycled or have its owned mounts/devices cleaned
before reuse. No existing host disks should be supplied to these scripts.

## Oracle and durability boundary

The worker seals two 32-document segments, updates and upserts rows in both,
then deletes one row from each segment and flushes/closes. These 62 live rows
and two deletions form the durable baseline. The operation attempts another 64
inserts. For
flush/optimize, those writes occur before the READY checkpoint; insert performs
them after it. The parent arms the fault only after observing READY and SIGSTOP.
Optimize seals and flushes its additional rows before READY, so injected faults
reach compaction rather than its preliminary sealing. All 126 rows are therefore
required after every optimize fault/cut. Insert/flush permit partial extra rows
until their final durable mark. Every operation checks per-document statuses and
ends with an explicit flush.

After a failure or an intermediate power-loss cut, all 62 baseline documents and the two baseline deletions must
survive. Additional recovered documents may be present, but their fields and all
indexes must agree. At the completed-operation replay mark, all 126 live documents are
required because the worker has acknowledged a successful flush.

Verification checks complete fields, counts, exact vector results, filtered
results, and both FTS fields. It then inserts, updates, deletes, and reinserts a
new primary key, flushes, optimizes, closes, reopens, and checks the results again.
Each mutation is checked immediately; an update to a recovered row must survive
flush/optimize/reopen. Both workers share field, historical-generation, vector,
and FTS checks. Vector queries check analytical L2 distances and small top-k
ordering; FTS fields use different vocabularies, term frequencies, and lengths.
Small top-k FTS scores are checked against full results. Analytical BM25 scores
are additionally checked for the pristine single-segment checkpoint corpus;
mutated corpora may retain deleted physical rows in per-segment statistics.

Optimize checks the manifest before and after execution: at least two persisted
input segments must be replaced by one new merged segment. Successful recordings
include `COMPACTION_INPUTS` and `COMPACTION_COMPLETE` evidence.

Errors exit without collection destructors so that a cleanup flush cannot repair
the failed operation before the parent observes it.

## Fault model limits

- ENOSPC uses real filesystem exhaustion, not a mocked return value. The preload
  library audits ENOSPC returned from covered database open/write/sync/mkdir calls.
- EIO interception covers `write`, `pwrite`, `pwrite64`, `fsync`, `fdatasync`, and `msync`
  in this test process and only paths below the collection directory. File filters
  select later stages; the vector case resolves the mapped file through `/proc/self/maps`
  and targets its `msync` request. Delayed injection requires a successful write before the
  fault. `fault.json` and the audit log identify the selected operation and path. It does not
  cover asynchronous mmap writeback errors, direct syscalls bypassing libc, rename/unlink, or hardware
  device failures. The library is not linked into production targets.
- Power loss uses Linux `dm-log-writes` and the pinned upstream `replay-log` tool.
  Every cut starts from the same clean baseline; normal filesystem recovery runs
  when the reconstructed image is mounted. Later unmount writes from recording
  are excluded. This samples block-write persistence states, including FLUSH/FUA
  boundaries; it is not physical power cycling or an exhaustive enumeration of
  device reordering/torn writes. The recorded DURABLE mark is not preceded by an
  extra host sync that could hide a missing application flush.

## Reproduction and artifacts

The artifacts include the commit, run ID, seed, operation, injection audit, worker
output, command logs, JUnit, and selected replay limits. Failed disk-full/EIO cases
also retain `after-fault.img` from before database recovery. Failed power-loss
cases retain `baseline.img`, `writes.img`, and `cuts.json`; these reconstruct every
failed cut even though verification modifies the replay image.

Build the native workers using the project's normal CMake configuration:

```sh
cmake --build build --target crash_recovery_binaries storage_fault_worker
cc -shared -fPIC -O2 -Wall -Wextra -Werror scripts/stability/io_fault.c -ldl -o build/lib/libstorage_fault.so
STORAGE_FAULT_LIBRARY="$PWD/build/lib/libstorage_fault.so" python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/stability -v
python3 scripts/stability/run_recovery.py --build build --output artifacts/recovery --seed 759
python3 scripts/stability/run_storage_faults.py --mode disk-full --worker build/bin/storage_fault_worker --injector build/lib/libstorage_fault.so --output artifacts/disk-full
python3 scripts/stability/run_storage_faults.py --mode io-errors --worker build/bin/storage_fault_worker --injector build/lib/libstorage_fault.so --output artifacts/io-errors
python3 scripts/stability/run_storage_faults.py --mode power-loss --worker build/bin/storage_fault_worker --replay-log /absolute/path/to/replay-log --output artifacts/power-loss --seed 759 --cuts 8
```

CMake generates `build/recovery-suites.txt` from the same registered targets used
by `crash_recovery_binaries`; adding a suite requires no workflow or runner list
change. New storage paths/index types still require explicit workloads and fault
points.

Output directories must not already exist. The replay-tool revision and build
steps are pinned in the workflow.
To reproduce a failed power cut, copy `baseline.img` to a new disposable image,
attach only that copy to a new loop device, and run `replay-log --log writes.img
--replay <new-loop-device> --limit <cut>`. Mount it and invoke `storage_fault_worker
<mount>/collection verify plain|fts 64` (use `128` for the durable cut). Running the
verifier changes the image, so always start each attempt from a fresh copy.
